Title: About

Hello! Thank you for your interest in reading my page. I am a full-stack engineer based in Raleigh, North Carolina. I currently work at Abrigo on a team responsible for switching between products to help address issues or areas of rapid development, along with pioneering new product development based on business needs. Previously I worked at Neo IP as the lead and sole engineer managing the Patent Forecast platform, a patent analytics website that was used internally to aid the law firm's projects as well as for outside consumer use in analyzing technology industries.

I graduated in May of 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber Security. During my time there then I also conducted undergraduate research related to communications, privacy, and cyber security which led to a provisional patent application filed during my senior year.
